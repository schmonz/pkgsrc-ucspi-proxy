ucspi-proxy contains a proxy program that passes data back and forth
between two connections set up by a UCSPI server and a UCSPI client. The
simple usage is:

    UCSPIserver [address] UCSPIclient [address] ucspi-proxy

Replace "UCSPIserver" with the program that will accept connections, and
"UCSPIclient" with the program that will make connections.
